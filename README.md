## Description

__TinyDrive__ is a web application that has taken inspiration from many of the tools we may use on a daily basis. It allows a user to upload a file to the application and generate or customize the URL that links to the uploaded file. The uploader can set permissions on the URL that put restrictions on any users the file is shared with. Permissions include a time frame that the URL is valid for and read/write privileges. A user can upload and edit text files, common images files, and Microsoft Office files through the web interface.
